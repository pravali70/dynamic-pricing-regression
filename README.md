# 🚕 Dynamic Pricing Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this exciting machine learning project on Dynamic Pricing Prediction for ride-hailing services!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world dataset related to dynamic pricing in the ride-hailing industry. The dataset captures various customer, location, and ride-specific attributes that influence the ride fare under changing demand and supply conditions.

Our goal is to build a complete regression pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model development and evaluation—to accurately predict the price of a ride.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to build and compare the performance of multiple regression models to predict the dynamic ride fare.

This project empowers ride-hailing platforms to:

Optimize pricing strategies

Balance real-time supply and demand

Improve revenue management

Enhance customer satisfaction and driver incentives

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
The following regression models are implemented and evaluated:

Multiple Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

Tuned Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To measure model performance in predicting continuous values, the following metrics are used:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Average of squared differences

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Square root of MSE, penalizes larger errors

These metrics help assess accuracy, error consistency, and robustness of the models.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built in Python, using the following libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

numpy – Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Regression models and tuning tools

xgboost – Gradient boosting regression

scipy – For tuning and optimization tasks

## ✅ Outcome
By evaluating all models using regression metrics, we aim to:

Identify the most accurate model for dynamic fare prediction

Understand key features influencing ride prices

Enable data-driven pricing strategies to maximize profits while maintaining customer loyalty

💡 Thanks for checking out this project! We hope it provides valuable insights into how machine learning can power smart pricing in the transportation industry.
